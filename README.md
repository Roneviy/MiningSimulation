# Mining Simulation with SHA256

This simple JavaScript program simulates a mining process using the SHA256 hash function. The mining process involves finding a nonce value that, when combined with the block information, produces a hash with a specific difficulty level.

## Features

- Adjust the mining difficulty by modifying the number of leading zeros in the hash.
- Track the number of attempts made to find a valid hash.
- Displays the details of each attempt, including the new hash.

## Usage

1. Install Node.js if not already installed.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Run the mining simulation: `node index.js`.

## Code Structure

- `mining_simulation.js`: The main script containing the mining simulation logic.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for Node.js project dependencies.
